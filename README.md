# ADAS (Advanced driver-assistance system) 🚗
## Introduction
Welcome to the ADAS_FinalProject !
This is my graduation project from NTI batch 6.
ADAS refers to a set of technologies and systems designed to assist drivers in the driving process and make driving safer and more comfortable.

## ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistant System) with some features
  * Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) 🚘 : Adjusts the vehicle's speed to maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead.
  * Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) 🛑 : Automatically applies the brakes if a collision is imminent and the driver does not react in time.
  * Lane Keeping Assistant System (LKAS) 🛣 : Actively helps the driver keep the vehicle within its lane.
  * Lane Departure Warning (LDW) ⚠ : Alerts the driver when the vehicle unintentionally drifts out of its lane.

## Other Project Features
1. Displaying vehicle speed and driving mode on attractive Infotainment system (GUI) created using python. Developed on Linux ubuntu OS.

2. Updating the software using FOTA 🌐 (Flash Over The Air) for any ECU
   * Implemented Bootloader for STM32F446RE based on CAN.
   * Implemented CAN drivre for STM32F446RE and  BluePill STM32F103C8T6.
   * Bluepill as a gateway to communicate with different ECUs via CAN.
   * ESP32 as a telematics unit connected with Bluepill  via UART.
   * STM32F446RE as an ECU.
3. Cyber security 🔓
   * Simulating Secure Booting using UDS for securing new software updates for data integrity and confidentiality.
   * Creating symmetric key using RSA algorithm  to unlock ECUs.
