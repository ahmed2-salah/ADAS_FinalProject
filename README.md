# ADAS (Advanced driver-assistance system)
## Introduction
Welcome to the ADAS_FinalProject !
This is my graduation project from NTI batch 6.
ADAS refers to a set of technologies and systems designed to assist drivers in the driving process and make driving safer and more comfortable.

## Features
 **ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistant System) with some features:**
* Adaptive cruise control (ACC)    -->Adjusts the vehicle's speed to maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead.
* Lane keep Assistant (LKA)        --> Actively helps the driver keep the vehicle within its lane.
* Lane Departure warning (LDW)     --> Alerts the driver when the vehicle unintentionally drifts out of its lane.
* Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)--> Automatically applies the brakes if a collision is imminent and the driver does not react in time.

This system is displayed on attractive Infotainment system created using python.

we can updating the software using FOTA (Flash Over The Air) with Bootloader customized for STM32F446 based on UART.

Implemented CAN driver for STM32F446 and STM32F103 to communicate with each other as 2 ECUs to exchange data.
